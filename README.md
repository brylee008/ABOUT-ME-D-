# ABOUT-ME- :) 


Ask yourself a question: What score or stat are you most proud of? 

Here's my answer to this: 
If I could track one metric, it would be the expected uplift I create in other people’s lives per interaction—call it

𝐸[ Δ𝑉 ∣ interaction],


where 
𝑉
is a crude “well-being + clarity + capability” utility. Most performance stats are single-period and private; this one is repeated-game and public, compounding like reputation. In practice it’s Bayesian: after an interaction, do others update their posterior on the day, the project, or themselves in a positive direction (likelihood ratio > 1)?

Of course the process is stochastic. On some days I’m near the mean—white noise around zero. On others, I fall into the left tail and underperform my own benchmark. But what I optimize for is a right-skewed, heavy-tailed distribution: a few rare, high-impact contributions that dominate the long-run sum—showing up at 2 a.m., telling the hard truth cleanly, absorbing variance for the team. Those fat-tail “outlier” events matter far more than small daily fluctuations.

Operationally, I treat character like a portfolio:

Low latency, high reliability: minimize time-to-help and missed signals (reduce variance).

Positive convexity: be most useful precisely when stakes become nonlinear (crises, inflections).

Drawdown control: protect against permanent impairment of trust; never “over-leverage” promises.

If someone computed a rolling Sharpe of my presence, I’d want it positive with occasional spikes—evidence of convex payoffs delivered when it counted. But even more than Sharpe, I care about path-dependence: in repeated games, small, consistent deltas compound, and a few tail wins set the trajectory.

So while I can’t publish this metric, it’s the stat I try to maximize: raise others’ expected value in the system we share. Some days I’m noise; some days I’m a left-tail miss. But the goal is a distribution with humility in the center, integrity in the left guardrails, and meaningful right-tail outcomes that change someone’s posterior about what’s possible.
